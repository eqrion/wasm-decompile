# wasm-decompile

Prototype of a lightweight decompiler of wasm bytecode.

## Goals

  1. Translate the stack machine into an expression based syntax
  2. Reconstruct structured control flow
  3. Stick fairly close to core wasm semantics
  4. Stay up to date with the spec and new extensions

## Non-goals

  1. Decompile to a real language (which could then be re-compiled)
  2. Compete with real decompilers like Ghidra/IDA

## Status

*WIP*
